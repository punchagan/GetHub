GetHub is a Chrome extension that displays desktop notifications for
new updates in your Github NewsFeed.

GetHub was made for the geeks whose primary Social Network is GitHub
and who keep checking for updates, a dozen times every hour. :)

* Usage

  1. Install GetHub.

     1. You can get it from the [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jnbbnckmmoohlahncbahecdjcpomkahh?hl=en-US#][store]]  OR 

     2. install it from the [[https://github.com/punchagan/GetHub][git repository]].  Follow the steps described
        in #4 of the *Create and load and extension* [[http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html][section]]
       
  2. Add your GitHub username and token to GetHub's options.  You can
     find your github token either in your local ~/.gitconfig file or 
     in the Github news feed URL (at the top right of github.com when
     logged in).

  3. You may also set the frequency at which you wish to check for new
     updates and the notification display time.

  4. Optionally, you can also enable the option of being notified for
     your own actions.
